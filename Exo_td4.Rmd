Here we have a data table per year (from 1937 to 1960) the longest distance in airmiles, wich can be flight by a plane.


```{r}
am <- read.csv("data/airmiles.csv");
library(ggplot2);

ggplot(data=am, aes(x=time, y=airmiles)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Distance")

```

The grpahic shows us that almost every year the distance increases.
Except maybe in 1946, 47, 48 and 1957, 58, where we can see stagnating zones.
